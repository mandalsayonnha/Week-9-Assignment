# Week-9-Assignment

WRITE-UP

For this assignment I followed the steps outlined in the Week 9 Codepath page and used the modern honeypot tool. I operated the attack using the IP 35.225.52.12 . I could see the attcks outlined for my mhn-honeypot-2 sensor.
NMAP was able to use tools like pcap, smbd, epmapper and provided the ip information. I have downloaded the session.json file and included it here.
